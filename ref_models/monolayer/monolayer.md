*Brief description*: A single cell (in the center of a 2D domain) undergoes division, resulting in a growing circular monolayer of cells. The only forces are repulsive - cells nudge away their neighbor cells. There are no signals in the microenvironment, so no cell chemotaxis, etc.. Cells do not undergo motility either; they are only “motile” due to the cell-cell repulsive forces.
