*Brief description*: a single cell moves horizontally (motility vector= (1,0,0)) across a 
2D domain and stops when it reaches a certain x-value. Movement can be random with a specified
bias [0,1], where 0=random movement; 1=perfectly horizontal movement.

### PhysiCell biased motility

* Showing 30 replicates on each frame. Stochasticity of replicates is due to randomly seeding the PRNG.
