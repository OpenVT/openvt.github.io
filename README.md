# Open Virtual Tissues (OpenVT)

The main site for the OpenVT project is at [openvt.org](https://openvt.org).

This page ([openvt.github.io](https://openvt.github.io)) is intended to capture more timely technical progress of the OpenVT project.

## Background

OpenVT seeks to build an engaged community of researchers - modelers and software engineers who use and develop open source multicellular modeling frameworks. These frameworks allow virtual experiments (simulations) of cell behaviors within tissues and organs. The goals of OpenVT are to:

* educate the community of modelers on the features that each framework offers, via
  - a living spreadsheet with features of each framework
  - links to documentation and tutorials
  - publications that used a framework to build a model or highlight functionality
  - reference models to compare simulation results from different frameworks
* provide easier model sharing between frameworks
* provide steps toward model reproducibility between frameworks
* share ideas or functionality between frameworks
* seek new funding opportunities related to this overall project

## Papers comparing frameworks

Some relevant publications that have compared multicellular modeling frameworks include: 

* Comparing individual-based approaches to modelling the self-organization of multicellular tissues (2017).

## Frameworks and their features

We will maintain "living" tables that list openly accessible multicellular
modeling frameworks and their features. We encourage the community of developers
and users to notify us of corrections and updates to these tables. The easiest way
to do so is by updating a text-based schema associated with each framework that is stored in GitHub. Details coming in the near future.
