          <h3>Indiana University</h3>
          <p>James Glazier is Principal Investigator in the NSF OpenVT project and a professor of
            Intelligent Systems Engineering and faculty member at the Biocomplexity Institute. He is a
            luminary in the field of multicellular modeling. His pioneering Cellular Potts Models
            and efforts utilize physics-based computer simulations into embryonic development, as well
            as developmental and chronic toxicity and diseases. His work extends to contributions to the
            Digital Human Project and the development and optimization of treatments for various diseases,
            setting a benchmark in the application of computational methods in biology.</p>
