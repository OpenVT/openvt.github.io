    <p>This project has been funded by the National Science Foundation Award Number 2303695 “Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE): PHASE II: Open VT - A Standardized Ecosystem for Virtual Tissue Simulation.”</p> 
    
    <p>This is a NSF-funded project advancing OpenVT, an open-source community initiative designed to broaden the use and development of Virtual Tissues (VTs) simulations. These models are both normal and diseased biological states. VTs are used in drug research and the creation of Medical Digital Twins, enabling researchers to conduct virtual experiments that enrich our understanding of complex biological systems while complementing traditional lab studies. This community will enrich and unify existing modeling frameworks, equipping the biomedical community with the necessary tools, resources, and standards to enhance collaborative efforts. OpenVT will concentrate on leading open-source multicellular modeling and integrate where possible with network models of signaling and metabolism to enhance model reproducibility and interoperability. We promote scientific progress in biotechnology and medicine.</p>
    
    <p>The project promotes discussion, collaboration, and cross-framework development, supporting educational initiatives to advance STEM education and train future scientists. All project outcomes will eventually be accessible at OpenVT.org.</p>
