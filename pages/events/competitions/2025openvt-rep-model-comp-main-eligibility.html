    <h2>2025 Inaugural OpenVT Reproducible Agent-Based Multicellular Model Competition Promoting Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reproducible (FAIR) Simulations</h2>

    <p class="custom-list-p"><a href="/pages/events/competitions/2025openvt-rep-model-comp.html">Announcement</a></p>


    <p class="custom-list-p">Am I eligible?</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"> The competition is primarily aimed at early career researchers, including but not limited to PhD students, postdocs, staff scientists, and research assistants. The competition is open to researchers from academia and industry. Individuals and small groups who developed the model are both eligible to compete.
    </p>
    <ul class="custom-list">
      <li>Individual: Applicant need not be the first author, but rather a modeller and co-author of the manuscript describing the model.</li>
      <li>Team: If multiple individuals were primary developers of the model, a small team can also apply.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="custom-list-p">How do I apply to the competition?</p>
    <ul class="custom-list">
      <li>Models must be published in a refereed journal published on or after January 1, 2023 and publicly distributed, e.g. by prior submission to a public model repository such as BioModels or through a public GitHub site or similar resource (GitLab, SourceForge, BitBucket, etc). </li>
      <li>Submit your model <a href="https://forms.gle/7u7tNj2mE5p9yytd8">apply here</a>. Deadline for submissions has been extended April 25, 2025.</li>
    </ul>



    <p class="custom-list-p">What prizes could I win?</p>

    <ul class="custom-list">
      <li>Up to three awards:  First Place $400, Second Place $200, Third Place $100.</li>
      <li>Winners will be invited to present in the <a href="https://glimprint.org/seminars/">Global Alliance for Immune Prediction and Intervention (GLIMPRINT) virtual seminar series</a>.</li>
