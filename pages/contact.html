    <p>Agent-based Virtual Tissue (VT) multicellular modeling is indispensable in understanding complex biological phenomena from tissue development to disease progression. The diversity in modeling and simulation methods poses challenges in reproducibility, modularity, reusability, and integration of multiscale models.</p>
    <p>The OpenVT Community aims to improve the usability of virtual tissues by defining and distributing standards and  best practices for the creation of genuinely FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principle virtual tissues leading to wider use in therapeutic approaches, toxicology, drug discovery and personalization of testing and treatment.The OpenVT Community supports the expansion of and broader adoption of multicellular modeling beyond academic research labs into greater industry practice. </p>
